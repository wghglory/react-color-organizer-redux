# Color Organizer React Redux

The Color Organizer allows users to add, name, rate, and remove colors from their customized list. The entire state of the color organizer can be represented with a single array.

```javascript
{
    colors: [
        {
            "id": "0175d1f0-a8c6-41bf-8d02-df5734d829a4",
            "title": "ocean at dusk",
            "color": "#00c4e2",
            "rating": 5
        },
        {
            "id": "83c7ba2f-7392-4d7d-9e23-35adbe186046",
            "title": "lawn",
            "color": "#26ac56",
            "rating": 3
        },
        {
            "id": "a11e3995-b0bd-4d58-8c48-5e49ae7f7f23",
            "title": "bright red",
            "color": "#ff0000",
            "rating": 0
        }
